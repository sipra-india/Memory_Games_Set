# AgeWell

## Inspiration üöÄ
The AgeWell project was inspired by the challenges and needs of older adults in maintaining their cognitive health and well-being. The team aimed to create an engaging solution for seniors to enhance their memory skills and counter cognitive decline. Additionally, data analysis was employed to assess and compare user performance and progress.

## What it does üéØ
AgeWell is a web app designed to aid seniors in memory improvement through brain training games. It offers various word memory games, including word recall, word ordering, and word unscrambling. Users receive personalized feedback based on their performance and progress. The app prioritizes user-friendliness, accessibility, and an enjoyable experience for seniors.

## How we built it üîß
- AgeWell was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for frontend development. React enhanced interactivity and dynamism.
- Python and Matplotlib were harnessed for data analysis, with Pandas for data manipulation and examination.
- Data extraction utilized R and RStudio. Data from the ACTIVE study, a comprehensive, long-term investigation into the impact of cognitive interventions (memory, reasoning, and processing speed) on older adults, was processed in R. Data was then exported to CSV.

## Challenges we ran into üöß
Challenges included integrating frontend and backend technologies, converting R models to Python, and cross-device and cross-browser app testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ
- Developing a web app that boosts seniors' memory skills: AgeWell offers a fun and engaging memory enhancement experience for seniors.
- Leveraging data analysis to measure and compare user performance and progress: Personalized feedback and recommendations are provided based on user performance.
- Completing the project on schedule: Despite challenges, the team delivered the project within the allotted time frame.

## What we learned üìö
- Skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for crafting responsive, interactive web apps.
- Proficiency in Python and Matplotlib for data visualization and analysis.
