## Age Well

## Inspiration 🚀
We were inspired to create AgeWell after learning about the challenges and needs of older adults in maintaining their cognitive health and well-being. We wanted to create a fun and engaging way for seniors to improve their memory skills and prevent cognitive decline. We also wanted to use data analysis to measure and compare the performance and progress of our users.

## What it does 🎯
AgeWell is a web app that helps seniors improve their memory through brain training games. The app provides different types of word memory games, such as word recall, word ordering, and word unscrambling. The app also provides personalized feedback to the users based on their performance and progress. The app is designed to be user-friendly, accessible, and enjoyable for seniors.

## How we built it 🔧
- We built AgeWell using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React as our frontend technologies. We also used  React library to make our app more interactive and dynamic.
- We used Python and matplotlib as our data analysis tools. We also used Pandas to manipulate and analyze the data.
-We used R and RStudio as our data extraction tool. We used the data from the ACTIVE study, which is a large-scale and long-term study that tested the effects of three cognitive interventions (memory, reasoning, and speed of processing) on older adults1. We used various functions and commands in R to explore and export our data to csv.

## Challenges we ran into 🚧
We faced some challenges in integrating our frontend and backend technologies, converting our R model to Python, and testing our app on different devices and browsers.
